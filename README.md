Coinsnap is a Lightning payment provider and offers a payment gateway for processing Bitcoin and Lightning payments. A merchant only needs a Lightning wallet with a lightning address to accept Bitcoin and Lightning payments on his web store.

## Features ##

* **Accept Bitcoin and Lightning payments** in your online store **without running your own technical infrastructure.** You do not need your own server, nor do you need to run your own Lightning Node. You also do not need a shop-system, for you can sell right out of your forms using the Coinsnap for Content Form 7-plugin.

    * No basic fee, no transaction fee, only 1% on the invoice amount with referrer code.
    * Without referrer code the fee is 1.25%.
    * Get a referrer code from our [partners](https://coinsnap.io/en/partner/) and customers and save 0.25% fee.
